# üõ∏ Overwatch Drone Services ‚Äì Home Project Internal Guide

---

## üéØ Purpose
- Serve as a reference for executing, documenting, and presenting a home-based drone inspection project.  
- Establish workflow, deliverables, and client-ready materials.  
- Template for future portfolio or client projects.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Setup
**Goal:** Build a tangible example of drone services.

- **Location:** Your house, yard, or nearby property (with permission).  
- **Project Type:** Aerial inspection & 3D modeling.  
- **Objective:** Demonstrate inspection, photogrammetry, 3D modeling, and reporting capabilities.

**Visual Reference:**

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Workflow
### Step 1: Pre-Flight Planning
- Define flight path: grid for mapping, perimeter sweep for inspection.  
- Determine altitudes covering entire property.  
- Check local regulations and compliance.

### Step 2: Data Capture
- Collect **100‚Äì150 high-resolution images**.  
- Ensure consistent lighting & minimal shadows.  
- Capture multiple angles for 3D reconstruction.

### Step 3: Data Processing
1. **Photogrammetry**  
   - Import aerial images into Pix4D / DroneDeploy to generate initial 3D point cloud and orthomosaic.  

2. **Blender 3D Modeling**  
   - Import point cloud or mesh into Blender.  
   - Clean up the model, fix textures, refine geometry.  
   - Add labels or highlights for inspection points (roof, siding, backyard).  
   - Render high-quality screenshots or prepare interactive 3D models for web embed.  

3. **Orthomosaic / Map Export**  
   - Export georeferenced stitched images for measurements and planning.

### Step 4: Analysis & Reporting
- Create **client-ready PDF report** including:  
  - Key findings  
  - Annotated images  
  - Screenshots of 3D models  
  - Suggested action items  
- Optional: short flythrough video of property for client overview.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Notes / Tips
- Keep **consistent file names**: `PropertyName_Date_Type`.  
- Document each step with **screenshots or video clips**.  
- Use this guide as a **template** for future portfolio projects.  
- Update deliverables as new capabilities (thermal imaging, LiDAR) are added.  
- Blender is **central for client-ready visualizations**, so maintain clean models and clear labeling.
